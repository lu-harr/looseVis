#' Drag points to nearest non-NA raster cell
#' 
#' Pinched from seegSDM which hasn't been maintained
#' https://github.com/SEEG-Oxford/seegSDM/blob/master/R/seegSDM.R
#' Written for raster but works fine with terra
#' (I use this function all the time !)
#' 
#' There is now the search_radius argument in terra::extract, but this doesn't
#' work if your raster has more than one layer, even if the layers have the same
#' mask - hence nearestLand()
#' 
#' (Should partition this and other functions into a terra toolkit but leaving
#' with visualisation toolkit for now)
#'
#' @param points two-column data.frame of coordinates
#' @param raster raster.
#' @param max_distance numeric. (search radius)
#'
#' @returns data.frame
#' @export

#' @examples nearestLand(dat_df, ras, 10000)
